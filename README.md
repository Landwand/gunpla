# GUNPLA 
(in progress)


## DESCRIPTION:
Portmanteau of __Gundam-Plastic-Model__. This is a browser-based inventory app for tracking my problem of buying to many plastic models.  Currently uses Flask is its backbone. The end-goal is to have a REST-API back-end along with a React UI.

A new user will be able to:

1. visit homepage
2. optionally create an account / login
3. **view**, **add** or **edit** their collection of plastic models
4. display their shame for wasting so much money
